Ubuntu Mate + i3
----------------

Best suited for ubuntu core/server.

To install, go to scripts/ and issue ./install, and
./download to get all the required packages (ubuntu/debian only)

# Notes to self

- Set up Vundle with:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim

vim +PluginInstall +qall
```

- To get remap keyboard, go to /etc/default/keyboard and fix it there
(ctrl:nocaps to override caps lock), and run dpkg-reconfigure console-setup

- To install rust:

```sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

- Use Emacs-style shortcuts in gtk:

```
