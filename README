Just some configurations files I use. This is mostly distro-independent, but
things like the ./download script will only work in debian (only wheezy tested)

To install, simply go to scripts/ and issue ./install, and ./download to get
all the required packages (debian only)

Notes to self
-------------

- To get remap keyboard, go to /etc/defaults/keyboard and fix it there
(ctrl:nocaps to override caps lock), and run dpkg-reconfigure console-setup

- for acer timelinex 3820t:
    - add GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="acpi_osi=Linux" in /etc/defaults/grup, and
      update-grup
    - add blacklist acer_wmi to /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf
    - add /dev/sda { apm = 255 } to /etc/hdparm.conf
