Just some configurations files I use. This is mostly distro-independent, but
things like the ./download script will only work in debian (only wheezy tested)

To install, simply go to scripts/ and issue ./install, and ./download to get
all the required packages (debian only)

Notes to self
-------------

- To get remap keyboard, go to /etc/default/keyboard and fix it there
(ctrl:nocaps to override caps lock), and run dpkg-reconfigure console-setup

- for acer timelinex 3820t:
	- add GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="acpi_osi=Linux" in /etc/default/grup, and
	update-grup
	- add blacklist acer_wmi to /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf
	- add hdparm -B 255 /dev/sda to /etc/rc.local
	- copy misc/50-hdparm_pm to /etc/pm/sleep.d/
