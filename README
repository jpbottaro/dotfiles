Just some configurations files I use.

To install, simply go to scropts/ and issue ./install, and ./download to get
all the required packages (debian only)

Notes to self
------------

- To get remap keyboard, go to /etc/defaults/keyboard and fix it there
(ctrl:nocaps to override caps lock), and run dpkg-reconfigure console-setup

- add blacklist acer_wmi to /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf

- add /dev/sda { apm = 255 } to /etc/hdparm.conf
