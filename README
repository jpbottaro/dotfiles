Just some configurations files I use. This is mostly distro-independent, but
things like the ./download script will only work in debian/ubuntu (for debian,
add gnome to the package list)

To install, simply go to scripts/ and issue ./install, and ./download to get
all the required packages (debian only)

To set up Vundle (for vim plugins) run:

git clone https://github.com/gmarik/vundle.git ~/.vim/bundle/vundle

And then :BundleInstall in vim

Notes to self (for linux)
-------------------------

- To get remap keyboard, go to /etc/default/keyboard and fix it there
(ctrl:nocaps to override caps lock), and run dpkg-reconfigure console-setup

- Install inconsolate by moving otf font to /usr/share/fonts/truetype/inconsolata/
  and issuing "sudo fc-cache -fv"
